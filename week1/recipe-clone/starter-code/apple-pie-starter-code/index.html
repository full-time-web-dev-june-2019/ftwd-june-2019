  <p class="heartwarming-story">
    This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one
    quite like it. It will always be my favorite and has won me several first place
    prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your favorites as well!

<h3 class="direct-head">Directions</h3>

<ol class="direct-list">
  <li>
    Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in
    flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce
    temperature and let simmer.
  </li>

  <li>
    Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a
    lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so
    that it does not run off.
  </li>
  <li>
    Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175
    degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.
